# Dungeons-Game

Here I constructed a game that allows a player to explore a dungeon and to interact with the things that are found there.
To be able to run the game the user has to download DrRacket. (https://racket-lang.org/)

The game will allow a player to type commands that cause something to happen in the dungeon. 
The Game will let this continue until the player quits the game, or some other event happens to force the game
to stop.
